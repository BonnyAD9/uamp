# Why should you use uamp?

### Speed and efficiency

Uamp uses minimal system resources while having no problem managing huge
amounts of songs.

### Simplicity

This is not simplicity of use (although the CLI is friendly and well
documented). Uamp is simple in principle. Music player should play music. That
is what uamp does and does that very well.

### Advanced features

Uamp has many advanced features that will allow you to enjoy listening to your
music. These features include gapless playback, fade play/pause, advanced queue
(playlist) management (queue stack) and much more.

### No bloat

Uamp is single binary that is about 18 MiB. Once compiled, it doesn't depend on
any other files except common system libraries.

### Documentation

Everything about uamp is well documented at multiple places. The complete basic
CLI documentation is the help command. There are also two manual pages: 1 for
the cli and general description and 5 for describing the documentation.
