# NO UI?

Let's address the elephant in the room. Uamp has no user interface. It is fully
controlled with commands from the terminal. This was meant to be only a
temporary change, but in the process, I realized that I didn't miss the UI.
Uamp is ready to play when my PC starts without me even knowing it. I have
assigned global shortcuts to essential actions such as Play/Pause, Next,
Previous, Volume Up and Down, and now I interact with the terminal interface
only when I need to do specific actions. Uamp runs entirely in the background
and consumes minimal resources (almost no CPU usage, no GPU usage, 10 - 15 MiB
of RAM).

I may add TUI or GUI in the future, but this will never become required. Uamp
will stay fully usable without UI, and the potential future UI will always be
optional (at compile time and runtime).
