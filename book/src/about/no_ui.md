# NO UI?

Lets address the elephant in the room. Uamp has no user interface. It is fully
controled with commands from terminal. This was ment to be only temporary
change, but in the process I realized that I didn't miss the UI. Uamp is ready
to play when my PC starts without me even knowing it. I have assigned global
shortcuts to the important actions such as Play/Pause, Next, Previous, Volume
Up and Down, ... and now I interact with the terminal interface only when I
need to do some specific actions. Uamp runs fully in the background and
consumes minimal resources (almost no CPU usage, no GPU usage, 10 - 15 MiB of
RAM).

In future I may add TUI or GUI, but this will never become necesity. Uamp will
stay fully usable without UI, and the potential future UI will be always
optional (at compile time and of course at runtime).
