# Alternatives to uamp

Of course these comparisions are very opinionated but there aren't any better
comparisions with uamp, because noone knows about it. If you like uamp,
consider giving it star on

## Uamp

Uamp is not alternative to uamp :) but lets first address the pros and cons of
uamp itself.

#### Pros
- Background blayback.
- Handles large amounts of songs without issues.
- Linux support.
- Fade play/pause.
- Many features, high configurability.
- It is simple to mix playlist.
- Has extensive CLI.
- It is simple to return to previous queue.
- Open source.
- Saves its state, properly handles exit signals.
- Has no issues while other demanding task is running.
- Quickly loads library.
- You can automate stuff (endless playback).

#### Cons
- No GUI.
- No global keyboard shortcuts. (You can use your OS with uamp CLI to achieve
  this.)

## Other players

These are players that I know of and I have at least little experience with.

### Strawberry

I settled on this player before creating uamp. It does everything well enough,
but also not quite well. It has its website
[here](https://www.strawberrymusicplayer.org/).

#### Pros
- GUI.
- Fade play/pause.
- Global keyboard shortcuts.
- Handles large amounts of songs well.
- Open source.

#### Cons
- GUI is hard to navigate at first.
- Poor dark theme support.
- Takes long time to find how to mix playlist.
- Has problem with playback while other demanding task is running.
- Global keybord shortcuts sometimes don't work.
- It is complicated to save and recover previous queue.
- Doesn't handle exit signals.

### Rhythmbox

I used this on my gnome laptop for a short period, but it was somehow very
annoying to use. It has its website [here](https://github.com/GNOME/rhythmbox).

#### Pros
- GUI.
- Dark theme support.
- Global keyboard shortcuts.
- Handles large amounts of songs ok.
- Open source.
- Supports playback on background.
- At least minimal CLI for controlling running instance.
- Linux support.

#### Cons
- No fade play/pause.
- Gui is unintuituve and frustrating.
- Takes forever to initially load all songs.
- Can't mix playlist? Its hard to find that option if it is there.
- I closed it, why it is still playing?
- No global keybord shortcuts (at least I couldn't find where to configure
  them).
- It is complicated to save and recover previous queue.
- Library sometimes unloads and has to be loaded again?

#### Winamp (legacy)

Winamp was the best player (apart from uamp) that I ever used on desktop. It
has many features and on windows everything works well. But now that I'm used
to some new features unique to uamp, I'm not sure that I would be able to go
back to winamp and be completely happy. Winamp has its website
[here](https://winamp.com/). I don't speak about the new garbage but about the
old legacy winamp.

#### Pros
- GUI.
- Dark theme support.
- Great global keyboard shortcuts.
- Handles large amounts of songs without issues.
- Windows support.
- Fade play/pause.
- High customizability.
- It is simple to mix playlist.

#### Cons
- No background playback.
- Unmaintained.
- Closed/questionable licence.
- GUI is complicated at first.
- It is complicated to save and recover previous queue.
- No linux support.
- When crashes, all state is lost.

### Elisa

I wanted to use this player because I use KDE plasma and I like to use apps
from the KDE ecosystem. But it was unable to handle my large library of songs.
It has its website [here](https://apps.kde.org/elisa/).

#### Pros
- GUI.
- Dark theme support.
- Gui looks well and seems to be intuitive.

#### Cons
- Cannot handle large amounts of songs.

### XMMS

Tries to be winamp, but just can't do anything. Maybe this is my feeling only
because I'm used to the winamp modern skin which is not available here. It is
old and unmaintained. I couldn't even find if it has any wiebsite.

### Audacious

Looks good. I can't remember what were my problems with it. Maybe the GUI was
so unintuitive that it scared me so I didn't try hard enough to customize it
enough to suit me. It has its website
[here](https://audacious-media-player.org/).
