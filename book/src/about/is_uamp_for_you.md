# Is uamp for you?

## Uamp is for you if
- **You aren't afraid of a terminal.** You will need to use it at least once.
- **You don't like bloat.** Uamp is small and uses minimal resources.
- **You don't want your music player to get in your way.** If uamp doesn't
  play, you don't know it's there.
- **You use Linux.** I don't know of a better player for Linux.
- **You have a local library of songs.** Uamp plays local music.

## Uamp is NOT for you if
- **You have a fear of a terminal that you are unwilling to overcome.** You
  will need to use the terminal at least once.
- **You are not using Linux, and uamp is not working correctly.** Support for
  other OSs is theoretical. I don't have any way to test anything on any other
  operating system.
- **You found a better music player for Linux.** Please let me know :)
- **You don't have a local song library.** You stream your songs from a
  streaming service. Uamp plays local music.
