# Is uamp for you?

## Uamp is for you if
- **You aren't afraid of terminal.** You will need to use it at least once.
- **You don't like bloat.** Uamp is small and uses minimal resources.
- **You don't want your music player to get in your way.** If uamp doesn't play,
  you don't know its there.
- **You use Linux.** I don't know of better player for Linux.
- **You have local library of songs.** Uamp plays local music.

## Uamp is NOT for you if
- **You have fear of terminal that you are unwilling to overcome.** You will
  need to use terminal at least once.
- **You are not using Linux and uamp is not working properly.** Support for
  other OSs is theoretical. I currently don't have any way to test anything on
  any other operating system.
- **You found a better music player for linux.** Please let me know :)
- **You don't have local song library.** You stream your songs from some
  streaming service. Uamp plays local music.
